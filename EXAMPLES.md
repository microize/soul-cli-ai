## Pro Tips

### 🎯 Effective Prompting
1. **Be specific**: "Create a React form with email validation" > "Make a form"
2. **Provide context**: Include tech stack, constraints, and goals
3. **Use examples**: Show similar code or desired output format
4. **Iterate**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up prompts

### ⚡ Productivity Boosters
```bash
# Generate entire project from description
soul --yolo "Create a Twitter clone with real-time updates"

# Analyze and fix all issues automatically
soul --yolo "Find and fix all bugs in this codebase"

# Generate tests for entire project
soul "Generate comprehensive test suites for all files"
```

### 🔧 Custom Workflows
Create `.gemini/commands/` in your project:

**deploy.toml**
```toml
name = "deploy"
description = "Deploy to production"
prompt = """
1. Run tests
2. Build project
3. Deploy to AWS
4. Run smoke tests
5. Update status page
"""
```

Then use: `/deploy` in Soul CLI
